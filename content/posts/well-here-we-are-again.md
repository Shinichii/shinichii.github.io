# Hi it's been a long time :wave:

How have you been ? 

I decided after a break to come back to blogging on my free time !

Here's what you can expect on this blog 
* Tutorials
* Security watch posts
* Mostly elements that I've learned or found interesting

I hope that you'll like this new format. I had run into issues with my previous provider, hopefully GitHub will be a bit more lenient :)

See you soon for some articles !
