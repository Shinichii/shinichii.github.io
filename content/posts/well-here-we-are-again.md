I decided after a break to come back to blogging on my free time !

Here's what you can expect on this blog 
* Tutorials (but don't expect a lot);
* Security watch posts ;
* Mostly elements that I've learned or found interesting.


Please be mindful that my publications are not : 

* Endorsed by my employer. I'm doing this on my free time because I want to share stuff that I find interesting.

* Eternal truths. Stuff changes, and things that I write may fall out of touch. I'll try to do my best to update though.

* To be taken at face value. I may be wrong on subjects and that's okay.

Please be nice. 

I hope that you'll like this new format. I had run into issues with my previous provider which lead me to abandon Medium. Hopefully GitHub will be a bit more lenient :)

See you soon for some articles ! If you like it, do not hesitate to reach out !
