Hi there ! Hope you're doing well !

I was willing to write on this subject for a long time but didn't really feel legitimate to do so as this activity seem trivial at first.

## A regular question I get

During the last years, I've gotten from friends and peers trying to start in the infosec industry the following question : 

> How do I break into cybersecurity ?

That question is a tough one. **What would you say ?** Should he get started in vulnerability testing ? Should he try to exploit a [Damn Vulnerable Web App]() ? Maybe buy a used disk on Ebay and forensic the shit out of it. Hell, you could even tell him to rent an ESXi and build a home lab.

I mean, those are all valid options. But I have an issue on all of them. They're all solely focused on the technical side of infosec. And don't get me wrong, all of these advices will give useful skills to navigate the field. But they're hard to get started on, and you can get quickly and easily frustrated.

Do I have a better solution ? Well I'm not sure if it's the best, but I think it helped me a lot getting better.

One of the main things I recommend newcomers or people interested in the field is to start a security watch.

## A security watch ? What is this ?

I'll start by giving out a troll answer : "You just follow shitposting accounts on Twitter until you understand why their shitpost is funny".

The concept of having a security watch is to keep up with the new discoveries in the field. Basically, be able to answer "What's going on ?".

Infosec is a vast domain and so there's always something new whether it is an attack, a vulnerability, a data leak, you get the picture. And that's actually what's great when starting out.

Because there's a lot of reading of do. And as [Peleus put it so well when I wanted to get started](https://netsec.ws/?p=468). 

> The ‘best’ way to learn often more time is spent procrastinating wondering these questions rather than dedicating the time to actually learning.

So get ready, today we're learning how to procrastinate efficiently.

## How do I get started ?

Basically it's going to be a three step-process on which we'll iterate.

Still interested ? Let's go.

### What would you like to learn ?

Well this question is not trivial. Do you already have a specific field of interest or a topic you wish to understand better ?

This will definitely ease the next step. If you do, you should search credible sources which will help.

If you don't, that's alright, you should start by looking into traditionnal media dedicated to infosec and work your way up from there.
